    "brand_story": """
    Born from the belief that clothing should be more than just fabric - it should be an expression of your inner strength. 
    Roar Threads was founded on the principle that every individual possesses a unique voice, a distinctive style, 
    and an untamed spirit waiting to be unleashed. Our journey began with a simple question: 
    'What if clothing could amplify who you truly are?'
    
    From streetwear that commands attention to premium pieces that whisper confidence, 
    every thread in our collection is carefully curated to help you make your mark on the world. 
    We believe that fashion is not about following trends—it's about setting them, 
    breaking boundaries, and letting your personality roar through every piece you wear.
    """,
    
    "mission": """
    To empower individuals to unleash their authentic style and express their unique identity through 
    premium, thoughtfully designed clothing that combines comfort, quality, and bold aesthetics. 
    We are committed to creating pieces that don't just dress your body, but dress your personality.

    "founder_message": """
    "Fashion has always been my language of self-expression. Growing up, I noticed how the right outfit 
    could transform not just how you look, but how you feel and how the world perceives you. 
    That's when I knew I wanted to create something different—a brand that celebrates individuality, 
    champions authenticity, and gives people the confidence to be unapologetically themselves.
    
    Roar Threads isn't just about clothing; it's about unleashing the fierce, confident, 
    and authentic version of yourself that's been waiting to break free. Every design we create, 
    every fabric we choose, every detail we perfect is done with one goal in mind: 
    to help you roar louder than ever before."
